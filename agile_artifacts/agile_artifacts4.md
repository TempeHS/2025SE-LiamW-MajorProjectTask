# Agile Artifacts

## Sprint Backlog List Achievable

9. general collision system
10. ownership system for units (enemy, ally)

## Increment

- implementing hitboxes 
- implement collision stopping (when units hitboxes collide they should stop or similar behaviour)
- structure collisions should effect pathing 
- ownership system where there are now units that can't be controlled by the user
- implement object selector methods (rebinding move commanding onto right mouse button and selection onto left mouse button)
- one of these methods should allow the cursor to draw a box and select all objects (under the user's ownership) within that box
