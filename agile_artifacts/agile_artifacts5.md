# Agile Artifacts

## Sprint Backlog List Achievable

11. enemy interaction (attacking)
12. Autopathing (workers and structures)
13. UI overlay

## Increment

- owner units and enemy units can interact with eachother by attacking commands and projectiles (so you'll need to make a moveset now)
- add a indicator that shows that a unit is selected
- when a worker unit is mining resources it will automatically path to it
- when a unit/worker is made from a structure it will inherit the path the structure has
- have UI overlay that is described in storyboards
